- The tool can be installed via Homebrew using [git-ca.rb](mdc:git-ca.rb) or built manually as described in [README.md](mdc:README.md).
- After installation, use the tool in any Git repository by staging changes and running `git ca`.
- On first use, the user is prompted to select an Ollama model for commit message generation.
- To change the default model, run `git ca model`.
- The tool requires Git (2.0+), Ollama running locally, and at least one language model installed in Ollama.

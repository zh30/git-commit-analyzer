# Commit Message Generation Rule

Commit messages are generated by analyzing staged changes using an AI model via Ollama, as implemented in [src/main.rs](mdc:src/main.rs). The tool enforces the Git Flow commit message format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

- `<type>`: One of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore` (choose only one, representing the primary purpose).
- `<scope>`: Optional, describes the module or area affected.
- `<subject>`: Short, imperative summary of the change.
- `<body>`: (Optional) Detailed description. **Note:** The tool typically omits the body for brevity.

**Rules enforced:**
- Only one commit message is generated per invocation.
- No issue numbers, footers, or unrelated explanations are included.
- The user can accept, edit, or cancel the generated message interactively.
- The default model for generation can be set or changed by the user.

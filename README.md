Git Commit Analyzer is a powerful Git plugin that leverages AI to automatically generate meaningful commit messages based on your staged changes. It uses MLX to analyze git diffs and propose commit messages following the Git Flow format, optimized for Apple Silicon devices.

## Features

- Automatic generation of Git Flow compliant commit messages
- Powered by MLX for local AI processing on Apple Silicon
- Interactive mode allowing users to use, edit, or cancel the proposed commit message
- Multi-language support (English and Simplified Chinese)
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS optimized, Linux support planned)
- Customizable with your personal Git signature
- Support for model selection and persistence
- Extremely fast inference with lightweight models

## Prerequisites

- Git (version 2.0 or later)
- Python 3.8 or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3 or later)
- MLX-LM installed: `pip install mlx-lm`
- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later

## Installation

### ðŸš€ One-Click Installation (Recommended)

The fastest way to install Git Commit Analyzer with a single command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://sh.zhanghe.dev/install-git-ca.sh)"
```

This will automatically:
- Detect your operating system
- Install all dependencies (Git, Rust, Python)
- Install MLX-LM for Apple Silicon
- Build and install the plugin
- Configure your environment
- Set up Git configuration

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

Alternatively, you can install via Homebrew:

```
brew tap zh30/tap
brew install git-ca
```

After installation, you can immediately use the `git ca` command.

### Manual Installation (Linux and macOS)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zh30/git-commit-analyzer.git
   cd git-commit-analyzer
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Create a directory for Git plugins (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.git-plugins
   ```

4. Copy the compiled binary to the plugins directory:
   ```
   cp target/release/git-ca ~/.git-plugins/
   ```

5. Add the plugins directory to your PATH. Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell):
   ```
   export PATH="$HOME/.git-plugins:$PATH"
   ```

6. Reload your shell configuration:
   ```
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Windows - theoretically possible 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zh30/git-commit-analyzer.git
   cd git-commit-analyzer
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Create a directory for Git plugins (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.git-plugins
   ```

4. Copy the compiled binary to the plugins directory:
   ```
   copy target\release\git-commit-analyzer.exe %USERPROFILE%\.git-plugins\
   ```

5. Add the plugins directory to your PATH:
   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'
   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'
   - Click on 'Environment Variables'
   - Under 'System variables', find and select 'Path', then click 'Edit'
   - Click 'New' and add `%USERPROFILE%\.git-plugins`
   - Click 'OK' to close all dialogs

6. Restart any open command prompts for the changes to take effect.

## How to Use

After installation, you can use Git Commit Analyzer in any Git repository:

1. Stage your changes in your Git repository (using the `git add` command).
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   git ca
   ```

3. If it's your first time running the command, you'll be prompted to select a model from the available MLX models.
4. Install MLX-LM if prompted: `pip install mlx-lm`
5. The program will analyze your staged changes and generate a suggested commit message.
5. You can choose to use the suggested message, edit it, or cancel the commit.

### Configuration Commands

To change the default model at any time, run:

```
git ca model
```

To set the output language for AI-generated commit messages, run:

```
git ca language
```

Available languages:
- English (default)
- Simplified Chinese (ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡)

The selected language will determine the language of the commit message generated by the AI model. Note that this affects the AI's prompt language, not the interface language.
